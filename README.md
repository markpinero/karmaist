[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/remarks/karmaist.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/remarks/karmaist)

## Key Points

* This project was created to showcase my skills using React and Redux.
* This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
* This project will utilize a back-end with Node.js and MongoDB for data persistence from the Todoist API.

## MVP

* This project should call the Todoist API and persist productivity and activity data in the back-end to quantify tasks added, completed and postponed.
* This project should show when I'm most productive.

## Future

* Implement the RescueTime Data API to match data.
* Implement Google Calendar API to match data.
